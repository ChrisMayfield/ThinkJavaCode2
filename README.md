# ThinkJavaCode2
Supporting code for Think Java, 2nd edition.
Copyright (c) 2017 Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield.
**This new edition is a work in progress and won't be completed until May 2019.**

This repository contains the code examples from the book and starter code for some exercises.
There are several ways you can work with the code:

* You can create a copy of this repository on GitHub by pressing the "Fork" button in the upper right.
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one.
After forking, you'll have your own repository on GitHub that you can use to keep track of code you write.
Then you can "clone" the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to your computer.

* Alternatively, you could clone the original repository without forking.
If you choose this option, you don't need a GitHub account, but you won't be able to save your changes on GitHub.

* If you don't want to use Git at all, you can download the code in a ZIP archive using the "Download ZIP" button on this page, or this link: http://tinyurl.com/ThinkJavaCode2.

To clone a repository, you need Git installed on your computer (see https://help.github.com/).
If you use Git from the command line, you can clone the original repository like this:

    git clone https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/ThinkJavaCode2.git

After you clone the repository or unzip the ZIP file, you should have a directory named `ThinkJavaCode2` with a subdirectory for each chapter in the book.

All examples in this book were developed and tested using Java SE Development Kit 8.
If you are using a more recent version, the examples in this book should still work.
If you are using an older version, some of them may not.
